Medical Record Management 
A well-organized medical record management system can be effective in improving patient information accessibility and completeness in hospitals despite the lack in resources, and yet in low-income countries, medical record management is often lacking. This is the case here in Egypt, where medical records are generally inadequately supported and poorly managed. This severe lack in medical record management is one of the many problems doctors face in Egypt; most of the time, there is now patient history for the doctor to work on, they have no idea what medicines the patient took before -except what he might remember-, this was one of the causes of the recent problems facing doctors with antibiotics; where patients have developed an immunity to a wide range of them. We sought to evaluate the impact of an inexpensive approach to this problem, improving the accessibility and completeness of patient information and on physician satisfaction while also taking in consideration the patientâ€™s privacy.
